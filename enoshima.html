                <i><p>Enoshima (江の島) is a small offshore island, about 4 km (2.5 mi) in circumference, 
                    at the mouth of the Katase River which flows into the Sagami Bay of Kanagawa 
                    Prefecture, Japan. Administratively, Enoshima is part of the mainland city of 
                    Fujisawa, and is linked to the Katase section of that city by a 389-metre-long 
                    (1276 ft) bridge. Home to some of the closest sandy beaches to Tokyo and Yokohama, 
                    the island and adjacent coastline are the hub of a local resort area.</p></i>
