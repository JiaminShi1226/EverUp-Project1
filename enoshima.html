                <i><p>Enoshima is a small island located in south Kanagawa Prefecture in the 
                    city of Fujisawa. Here you will find a beautiful view of Mt. Fuji and the 
                    Sagami Bay, which has resulted in Enoshima being a popular sightseeing area 
                    since the Edo period.

                <i><p>As this is a spot where you can leisurely sightsee within half a day with 
                    easy access from the city, the island is often busy with people on the weekends. 
                    The island is geographically similar to that of a small mountain, so it would 
                    be best to visit with clothing that is easy to move around in when you visit.</p></i>

                <i><p>Enoshima (江の島) is a small offshore island, about 4 km (2.5 mi) in circumference, 
                    at the mouth of the Katase River which flows into the Sagami Bay of Kanagawa 
                    Prefecture, Japan. Administratively, Enoshima is part of the mainland city of 
                    Fujisawa, and is linked to the Katase section of that city by a 389-metre-long 
                    (1276 ft) bridge. Home to some of the closest sandy beaches to Tokyo and Yokohama, 
                    the island and adjacent coastline are the hub of a local resort area.</p></i>
