            <i><p>One of the smaller firework festivals known as the kamakura hanabi taikai is held 
                annually at Yuigahama beach. This festival is known for using its speciality 
                “underwater fireworks”. This type of firework explodes in the water instead 
                of in the air, which creates a beautiful and colourful half-sphere on top of 
                the ocean layer.</p></i>
